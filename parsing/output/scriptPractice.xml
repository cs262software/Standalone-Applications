Say.
What, is Horatio there?
</text>
</line>
<line id='23' characterID='Horatio'><text>
A piece of him.
</text>
</line>
<line id='24' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
Welcome, Horatio:--Welcome, good Marcellus.
</text>
</line>
<line id='25' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
</text>
</line>
<line id='26' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
I have seen nothing.
</text>
</line>
<line id='27' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That, if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
</text>
</line>
<line id='28' characterID='Horatio'><text>
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
</text>
</line>
<line id='29' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
Sit down awhile,
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we two nights have seen.
</text>
</line>
<line id='30' characterID='Horatio'><text>
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
</text>
</line>
<line id='31' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
</text>
</line>
<line id='32' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!
</text>
</line>
<line id='33'><text>[Enter Ghost, armed.]
</text>
</line>
<line id='34' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
</text>
</line>
<line id='35' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
</text>
</line>
<line id='36' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
</text>
</line>
<line id='37' characterID='Horatio'><text>
Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.
</text>
</line>
<line id='38' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
It would be spoke to.
</text>
</line>
<line id='39' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Question it, Horatio.
</text>
</line>
<line id='40' characterID='Horatio'><text>
What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
</text>
</line>
<line id='41' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
It is offended.
</text>
</line>
<line id='42' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
See, it stalks away!
</text>
</line>
<line id='43' characterID='Horatio'><text>
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
</text>
</line>
<line id='44'><text>[Exit Ghost.]
</text>
</line>
<line id='45' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
</text>
</line>
<line id='46' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
</text>
</line>
<line id='47' characterID='Horatio'><text>
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
</text>
</line>
<line id='48' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Is it not like the King?
</text>
</line>
<line id='49' characterID='Horatio'><text>
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
</text>
</line>
<line id='50' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
</text>
</line>
<line id='51' characterID='Horatio'><text>
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
</text>
</line>
<line id='52' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land;
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
</text>
</line>
<line id='53' characterID='Horatio'><text>
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--
As it doth well appear unto our state,--
But to recover of us, by strong hand,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
</text>
</line>
<line id='54' characterID='Bernardo'><text>
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
</text>
</line>
<line id='55' characterID='Horatio'><text>
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,--
As harbingers preceding still the fates,
And prologue to the omen coming on,--
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climature and countrymen.--
But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
</text>
</line>
<line id='56'><text>[Re-enter Ghost.]
</text>
</line>
<line id='57'><text>I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
Speak to me:
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
[The cock crows.]
Speak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!
</text>
</line>
<line id='58' characterID='Marcellus'><text>
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
</text>
</line>
<line id='59' characterID='Horatio'><text>
Do, if it will not stand.
